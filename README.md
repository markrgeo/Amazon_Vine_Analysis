This study was designed to isolate the way that people interact with the Amazon Vine program, with a specific look at the sales of mobile devices and accessories. This program is specifically designed to facilitate product reviews from buyers which will go directly to sellers and manufacturers. 

This research made use of postgres, Google Colab, and Amazon RDS in order to store the data (RDS), convert it into usable data frames (postgres), and further manipulate it in order to perform analysis (Google Colab).

Five-star Vine reviews account for 36.22% of all Vine reviews.  The non-Vine reviews count 47.01% as being five-star reviews by comparison.



# Summary: 
We see we have a larger group of non-Vine users who are exceeding in their review posting for purchases made. However there is a solid group of individuals who are part of the Vine program who are commenting, and rating their purchases highly. However it still trails behind non-Vine users. 

To know if these ratings are effective on promoting greater sales, or on introducing innovations in product design with the manufacturers we will have to do further analysis.
